# Mother Nature

**Mother Nature** is an online quiz tool that extends a puzzle. It's a lightweight, browser-based project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no dependencies, just the essentials.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, all you need is the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code (or any similar live server tool).

### Steps to Run

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the **Live Server** extension if you haven’t already.
3. Right-click on the `starpagina.html` file in the file explorer.
4. Select **"Open with Live Server"**.
5. The page will open in your default browser, and you can start interacting with the quiz tool.

## Project Structure

- `<Name>` - Folder with the name of the page
    - `<Name>.html` – HTML file
    - `<Name>Style.css` – Contains all styling
    - `<Name>Script.js` – Contains logic

## Requirements
